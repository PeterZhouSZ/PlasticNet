Structured prediction of primitive shapes in point clouds

This is based on papers:
*Structured Prediction Energy Network* <https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06350>

*End-to-End Learning for Structured Prediction Energy Networks* <https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05667>

*PointNet++* <https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02413>

*Large-scale Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation with Superpoint Graphs* <http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09869>

*Point Cloud Oversegmentation with Graph-Structured Deep Metric Learning* <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.02113>.

Computing the correct distances requires installation of IGL library:
